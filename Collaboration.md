git# Collaboration Strategy

## Team Structure
We have decided to continue working individually without forming subteams.

## Branch Structure
Each team member has their own branch:
- `branch-milton-mahdi`
- `branch-alicia`
- `branch-chuqiao-yao`

This ensures that everyone can work independently while maintaining a clear structure for merging changes.

## Collaboration Approach
- No subteams or pair-programming.
- All work will be done asynchronously.
- Communication will primarily happen through virtual channels.

## Process
1. Each member works on their assigned tasks in their respective branch.
2. Changes are pushed to individual branches.
3. Members will review and merge changes as needed.

This document will be updated if any changes are made to the collaboration strategy.
